# 🚀 Linea Voyage — Mission Control

**Linea Voyage – Mission Control** is a fun and cosmic-themed **deployment benchmark DApp** designed to test the throughput and stability of private EVM networks and Linea-like environments.

Launch “warp orders”, watch your metrics update live, and log every transaction in the mission console.  
Because sometimes… benchmarking needs a bit of space magic. 🪐✨
