This Privacy Policy explains how On-Chain Membership dApp (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information when you access and use our decentralized application (“dApp”).

By accessing or using our dApp, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

1. Information We Collect

We do not collect personal data such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, or identification documents.

However, due to how blockchain technology functions, the following information may be publicly visible:

Public wallet addresses

On-chain transaction data

NFTs or tokens you mint, hold, transfer, or interact with

Smart contract interactions and metadata

This information is stored on public blockchains and cannot be modified or deleted by us.

2. Optional Data You Provide

If you voluntarily contact us through email, social platforms, or support forms, we may temporarily store:

Contact information (e.g., username or email)

The content of your messages

We will only use this information to respond to you.

3. Cookies & Web Analytics

Our dApp may use limited analytics tools or cookies to improve user experience, including:

Performance analytics

Browser and device data (non-identifying)

Third-party services may also collect data through embedded components such as:

Wallet providers (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect)

NFT marketplaces (e.g., OpenSea)

Blockchain networks (e.g., Linea, Ethereum)

These services operate under their own policies. We do not control or store their data.

4. How We Use Information

We use on-chain and technical information to:

Enable blockchain interaction features

Track mission completion and progression

Provide wallet-based membership utility

Improve performance and user experience

Detect suspicious or harmful activities

We never sell, rent, or commercialize your data.

5. Security

We apply appropriate security measures to protect system integrity.
However, blockchain networks operate independently from us, and:

Transactions are irreversible

Smart contracts may carry technological risks

Use blockchain systems responsibly and at your own discretion.

6. Data Retention

Since blockchain is public and immutable:

On-chain data cannot be deleted

Technical analytics may be deleted after operational use

You may disconnect your wallet at any time to stop using the service.

7. Children’s Privacy

Our dApp is not intended for users under 18.
We do not knowingly collect data from minors.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
The “Last updated” date will reflect the most recent version.

Continued use of the dApp after updates implies acceptance of the revised terms.
